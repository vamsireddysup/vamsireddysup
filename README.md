## 🚀 About Me

I'm a graduate student passionate about **hardware design verification**, **formal property checking**, and **performance-driven architecture modeling**. My projects span **PCIe verification using UVM**, **MIPS-lite pipeline simulation**, and **LLC design with MESI coherence** — all centered around building **resilient, testable, and performant hardware systems**.

My curiosity drives me to explore how **formal methods** can complement traditional simulation to create robust systems. I've also implemented complex testbenches in SystemVerilog, explored fault models, and worked hands-on with **DFT concepts like ATPG, MBIST, and scan compression**.

## 🔬 What I'm Working On

- 🎯 PCIe Transaction Layer UVM Testbench – full functional and constrained-random coverage
- 💡 Custom MIPS-lite simulator for pipeline timing, stall modeling, and hazard detection
- 🧪 Formal verification of sequence detectors using **Synopsys VC Formal (AEP, FXP, FPV, FCA)**
- 🛠 DFT flow simulation, fault analysis, and IJTAG/MBIST implementation using Tessent

---

## 🤝 I’m Open To:

- Collaborating on **open-source or industry-relevant verification projects**
- Contributing to **academic or RTL-level simulators**
- Joining communities focused on **RISC-V, Formal Verification, or DFT**
